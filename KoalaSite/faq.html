            <h2>How do Koala's behave?</h2>
            <p class="gray">Nocturnal mammals, koalas sleep for up to 16 hours a day. They are arboreal, which means that they live in trees. They do not live in big groups but rather prefer to be alone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How do Koala's populate?</h2>
            <p class="gray">Koalas breed once a year. Gestation lasts 35 days, after which one koala is born. The baby koala is very small when it is born, and lives in its mother's pouch for five to seven months. After this time, koalas gradually become independent and survive on their own.</p>

            <p class="gray">Once numbering in the millions, koalas suffered major declines in population during the 1920s when they were hunted for their fur. Today, habitat destruction, traffic deaths, and attacks by dogs kill an estimated 4,000 koalas yearly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How can we protect Koala's?</h2>
